# Merge Sort
A merge sort algorithm that splits the items to be sorted into two groups, recursively sort each group,
and merge them into a final, sorted sequence. Run time is Î˜(n log n).

# Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements of an array and swaps them if the element on the right is smaller than the one on the left.
It is an in-place sorting algorithm i.e. no extra space is needed for this sort, the array itself is modified.

# Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that allows for efficient, in-place sorting of the array, one element at a time. By in-place sorting, we mean that the original array is modified and no temporary structures are needed.

# Selection Sort
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
